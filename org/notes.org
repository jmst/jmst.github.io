[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMudHClToL0&lc=UgxXCwe-AJ2vum32Swt4AaABAg][A few years ago, whenever I was upset I used to play this song really loud out of my surround system. During the drum parts I would move around the house like donkey kong and just act like him and be very aggressive and get up in my family members faces. Once 00:46 kicked in I would start throwing things around and start making loud chimpanzee noises,  just going around the house flipping over chairs and throwing papers and stuff off tables and just making a huge mess of the house in minutes. My family came to dread this song whenever it played because they knew it meant one thing. Man I miss those days.]]

** quotes

Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
	Calvin Coolidge
	
Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.
	C.S. Lewis

[[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34711741][I handle it by collecting quotes that tell me to knock it off. I've since started to focus on just the things I really care about:]]

	The purpose of knowledge is action, not knowledge.
    ― Aristotle
    
    Knowledge isn't free. You have to pay attention  
    ― Richard Feynman
    
    "Information is not truth"  
    ― Yuval Noah Harari  
    
    If I were the plaything of every thought, I would be a fool, not a wise man. 
    ― Rumi
    
    Dhamma is in your mind, not in the forest. You don't have to go and look anywhere else.
    ― Ajahn Chah
     
    Man has set for himself the goal of conquering the world, 
    but in the process he loses his soul.
    ― Alexander Solzhenitsyn
    
    The wise man knows the Self,  
    And he plays the game of life.  
    But the fool lives in the world  
    Like a beast of burden.  
    ― Ashtavakra Gita (4―1)

    We must be true inside, true to ourselves, 
    before we can know a truth that is outside us.   
    ― Thomas Merton

    Saying yes frequently is an additive strategy. Saying no is a subtractive strategy. Keep saying no to a lot of things - the negative and unimportant ones - and once in awhile, you will be left with an idea which is so compelling that it would be a screaming no-brainer 'yes'.
    - unknown
#	
  Addiction is giving up everything for one thing, 
  sobriety is giving up one thing for everything
  
  A preoccupation with the means is a lack of commitment to the end.
  
  TS Elliot quote from his work, the Rock:

> “Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?” 

Pascal - All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone

We suffer from the beliefs that these things are bad. Pain is inevitable suffering is a choice. Your fighting yourself. Your mind is the real battlefield. 
“In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.” Meaning can transform suffering. In attributing meaning to your suffering, you loosen its grip on your mind and body. – Victor Frankl

To pretend, I actually do the thing: I have therefore only pretended to pretend. - Jacques Derrida

Real programmers set the universal constants at the start such that the universe evolves to contain the disk with the data they want.
MildBill boingboing.net

The trick to happiness wasn't in freezing every momentary pleasure and clinging to each one, but in ensuring one's life would produce many future moments to anticipate.
Oathbringer - Brandon Sanderson

You cannot solve a problem with the same level of thinking that created the problem
